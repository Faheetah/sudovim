<h2>The Site</h2>
<p>
I created this site as a personal technical reference and to improve my writing skills.
The title is a juxtaposition of the Linux commands <code>sudo</code> and <code>vim</code>.
I had owned the domain for a few years now and took the opportunity to hone my Ruby skills.
This site is publically posted should others find the information useful. It is written in Sinatra with Redcarpet for markup,
and uses Sequel to interface with the Postgres database. Redmine is installed on my home server to track issues for the project.
The site is rendered in HTML and CSS with no Javascript. The CSS utilizes flex if supported, but falls back to what should
be a more browser friendly implementation if not.
Overall, the site is a learning experience, and while it still has some quirks, I am overall pleased with how it turned out.
</p>
<p>
There are some <a href="/tools">tools</a> freely available on the site to use.
While I reserve the right for the content on the site (the writing of the articles),
any code (examples or from viewing the site's source) are free for use with no reservation.

<h2>Whoami</h2>
<p>
My name is Will. I work in cloud infrastructure as a support administrator. I have
<%= (Date.today - Date.parse('2011-8-1')).to_i / 360 %> years
<%= (Date.today - Date.parse('2011-8-1')).to_i / 30 % 12 %> months experience in the field.
Not so fun fact: That statistic is dynamically generated with <code>Date::today</code>.
